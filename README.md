<body>
Developing a PyTorch-based deep learning model for Multilevel hierarchical attention transfer for OCT image classiIication. The application of attention mechanisms can be coordinated across uniform or divergent scales, contingent upon the contextual framework.Implemented progressive analytical algorithms for precise classiIication of retinal images using fuzzy logic for selection of K-channels and enhanced diagnostic accuracy and efIiciency in ophthalmology through advanced image processing.
